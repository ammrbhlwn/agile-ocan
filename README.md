This is RPL Lectant FE Repository.

RPL-Lectant is a platform where we connect Informatika ITS student and lecturer who needs to hire Teaching Assitant for their classes. They can post an redruitment in RPL-Lectant as an offer. We help student to get information to become a Lecture Assistant thoroughly. We help Student and lecturer to work collaboratively.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
